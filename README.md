my lil entry to [js13kgames 2013](http://2013.js13kgames.com/).

wanna run this, sucka?
======================

build scripts? grunt? browserify? i don't need your witchcraft:

    cd server
    npm install
    npm start
    
    open http://localhost:8000      # uncompressed build
    open http://localhost:8000/prod # hella compressed build

when this project is done, i might remember to update this and link to a static page where you don't have to do this.

license
=======

i stole a few files:

- `src/vendor/extend.js` taken from MIT-licensed [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)
- `src/vendor/requestanimationframe.js` taken from [right here](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) and it's MIT
- `src/vendor/miniclass.js` was [written by me](https://github.com/EvanHahn/MiniClass) so i can do whatever the hell i want, _mom_

the rest of the stuff is licensed under that [unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) in LICENSE.txt.
